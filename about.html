            Startups and small businesses in Malawi struggle to establish an online presence due to limited technical skills and lack of practical marketing guidance. Existing solutions are often expensive, time- consuming, and priced in dollars, making them poorly suited to the local context. As a result, many businesses miss opportunities to grow online and reach their audience effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, student and entry- level developers lack access to real projects needed to gain hands- on experience. This creates a gap where businesses cannot get affordable digital solutions, and emerging developers cannot build practical skills. Bridging this gap requires a system that provides free marketing templates, practical guidance, and real project experience for developers, creating value for both businesses and the next generation of tech talent.
